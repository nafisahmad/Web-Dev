//1. Create a new React app.
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './Components/App';

//2. Create a App.jsx component.
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

//3. Create a Header.jsx component that renders a <header> element
//to show the Keeper App name in an <h1>.

//4. Create a Footer.jsx component that renders a <footer> element
//to show a copyright message in a <p> with a dynamically updated year.

//5. Create a Note.jsx component to show a <div> element with a
//<h1> for a title and a <p> for the content.

//6. Make sure that the final website is styled like the example shown here:
